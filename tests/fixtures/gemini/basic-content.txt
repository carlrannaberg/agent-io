Recursion is a programming concept where a function calls itself to solve a smaller version of the same problem.

It's a fundamental technique in computer science used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar sub-problems.

Key characteristics of recursion:
- A base case that stops the recursion
- A recursive case that calls the function with modified parameters
- Each call works on a smaller portion of the problem

Common examples include calculating factorials, traversing tree structures, and implementing divide-and-conquer algorithms.
