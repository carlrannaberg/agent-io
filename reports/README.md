# Reports Directory

This directory contains ALL project reports including validation, testing, analysis, performance benchmarks, and any other documentation generated during the development of agent-stream-fmt.

## Report Categories

### Implementation Reports
- `PHASE_X_VALIDATION_REPORT.md` - Phase completion validation reports
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY_[FEATURE].md` - Feature implementation summaries
- `FEATURE_[NAME]_REPORT.md` - Specific feature completion reports

### Testing & Analysis Reports
- `TEST_RESULTS_[DATE].md` - Test execution results
- `COVERAGE_REPORT_[DATE].md` - Code coverage analysis
- `SCHEMA_ANALYSIS_[VENDOR].md` - Vendor-specific schema analysis
- `FIXTURE_VALIDATION_REPORT.md` - Fixture validation results

### Performance & Benchmarks
- `PERFORMANCE_BENCHMARK_[DATE].md` - Performance test results
- `MEMORY_PROFILE_[SCENARIO].md` - Memory usage analysis
- `LOAD_TEST_[VERSION].md` - Load testing results

### Quality & Validation
- `CODE_QUALITY_REPORT.md` - Code quality metrics and analysis
- `SECURITY_AUDIT_[DATE].md` - Security vulnerability assessments
- `DEPENDENCY_REPORT.md` - Dependency analysis and updates
- `API_COMPATIBILITY_REPORT.md` - API breaking change analysis

## Purpose

These reports serve as:
1. **Progress tracking** - Document completion of each development phase
2. **Quality assurance** - Validate that implementations meet specifications
3. **Knowledge preservation** - Capture decisions and findings for future reference
4. **Performance documentation** - Track performance metrics over time

## Report Format

Each report should include:
- **Date** - When the report was generated
- **Phase/Component** - What part of the project is being reported on
- **Status** - Current state (e.g., ✅ Complete, ⚠️ In Progress, ❌ Failed)
- **Validation checklist** - Specific items checked
- **Key findings** - Important discoveries or issues
- **Recommendations** - Next steps or improvements needed

## Automated Generation

Some reports can be generated automatically:
```bash
# Generate schema analysis report
npm run fixtures:analyze > reports/SCHEMA_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md

# Generate performance report (future)
npm run benchmark > reports/PERFORMANCE_REPORT.md
```

## Version Control

All reports are tracked in git to maintain a historical record of project progress and decisions.
